TODO:

	- esp_file.c should probably be renamed since it only deals with
	  initial chip configuration data, and not file ops in kernel space
	- firmware filenames are off by one (ESP_FW_NAME1 should really be
	  called eagle_fw_first_init_v19.bin)
	- kill references to TEST_MODE
	- kill references to FPGA_DEBUG
	- checkpatch.pl cleanups (__FUNCTION__, ..)
