TODO:

	- esp_file.c should probably be renamed since it only deals with
	  initial chip configuration data, and not file ops in kernel space
	- TX A-MPDU aggregation is broken in icenowy/esp8089 (at least ESP8266
	  needs no_txampdu=1).  For unknown reasons it works in al177/esp8089.
	- RX A-MPDU aggregation seems to lose a packet (or more?) every time
	  esp_op_ampdu_action() is called with IEEE80211_AMPDU_RX_START
	- firmware filenames are off by one (ESP_FW_NAME1 should really be
	  called eagle_fw_first_init_v19.bin)
	- kill references to TEST_MODE
	- kill references to FPGA_DEBUG
	- checkpatch.pl cleanups (__FUNCTION__, ..)
